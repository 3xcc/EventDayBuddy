# EventDayBuddy

EventDayBuddy is a modern event management and check-in system for boat-based events, built with FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, Telegram Bot API, and Google Sheets integration. It is designed for reliability, admin control, and seamless staff workflows.

## Features
- Telegram bot for booking, check-in, and admin commands
- FastAPI web server with health checks and webhook endpoint
- Google Sheets integration for manifests and exports
- Role-based access: admin, booking_staff, checkin_staff, viewer
- Bulk import/export of bookings
- PDF/ID card generation and storage
- Admin-only `/runtests` command for CI/CD and safety

## Quick Start

### 1. Requirements
- Python 3.12+
- PostgreSQL (Supabase or local)
- Google Cloud credentials for Sheets API
- Telegram Bot Token

### 2. Environment Variables
Set these in your Render dashboard or `.env` (for local dev):
- `TELEGRAM_TOKEN` (required)
- `PUBLIC_URL` (required, must be HTTPS for Telegram webhooks)
- `DB_URL` (Postgres connection string)
- `GOOGLE_SHEET_ID`, `GOOGLE_CREDS_JSON` (for Sheets)
- `ADMIN_CHAT_ID` (for admin alerts)
- ...and others as needed (see `config/envs.py`)

### 3. Database Setup
```
alembic upgrade head
```

### 4. Run Locally
```
python main.py
```

### 5. Deploy to Render
- Connect your repo
- Set all required environment variables
- Use `python main.py` as the start command

## Testing
- **Local:** Requires all envs set (not recommended for safety)
- **Production:** Use `/runtests` Telegram command (admin only)
  - Runs all unit tests
  - Cleans up test data after run
  - Returns results as message or file
